## Usage

Pomodorogo run with config file.

Config file must have `schedule` field to define what sections going to run

each section must specific time, otherwise we don't know when to end

```ini
schedule = section break break


[section]
time = 25m

[break]
time = 5m
cmd = firefox github.com
```

to run pomodorogo timer(first time start will automatic create config for you)

```sh
pomodorogo
```

```sh
pomodorogo -c ./myconfig.ini
```
